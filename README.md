# mqtt-cpp-c
A collection of publisher/subscribers with a damn protocol.  
Install Paho.mqtt.c which only God knows how you'r gonna install this.  
Then create a makeFile which often have issues with tabs and spaces.  
And run makefile if you were able to create it.
And then nothing is going to happen. Yes!
